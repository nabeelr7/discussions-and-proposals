# React Native Issue Management Kickoff

In this kickoff meeting, we briefly went through the issue triage process for React Native Windows. We also discussed what we'd like to get out of these meetings. The outcome of these discussions is covered in the following sections.

## Goals

The primary goal of the triage meeting is to ensure issues are labeled properly and have clear reproduction steps, to request more information from issues that require it, and close issues. These actions should result in an actionable backlog of issues.

As part of the process, issue managers may identify broad patterns and documentation opportunities. These can result in the creation of actionable issues in the core repo, website repo, or a community repo. They may also identify areas of opportunity for automation and improvement of the efficiency of the triage process, to be documented in the core repo wiki.

Participants will engage meaningfully with React Native developers, communicating through issues with a broad timeline of what is being worked on, and when something is getting fixed. Participants will also ensure issues are being handled with the appropriate priority, identifying escalation paths as needed.

## Feedback

- We will need to develop better templates/bots to maintain a high quality bar for issues, and ensure they are actionable right from the time of filing.
- Handling issues that are not part of "core": We could add a bot that moves the issues to the respective repos including tagging the person who opened it and the owner of the repo and continue conversation there. It may be useful to keep 10 minutes per triage session for following up on most recent auto-moved issues to help out the community.
- There may be some assignment of issues during triage - but this is more about making the issues actionable than creating specific accountability with product crew during the meeting.
