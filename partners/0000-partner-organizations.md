# Partner organizations and the React Native Community organization

On April 17, 2019 an initial list of partner organizations was included in [a description of the React Native ecosystem](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a1250da64625c1da581fe600f805fd321cd12d4f) in the `facebook/react-native` repository.

> Partners are companies that are significantly invested in React Native and have been for years. Informed by their use of React Native, they push for improvements of the core and/or the ecosystem around it. Facebook's partners think of React Native as a product: they understand the trade offs that the project makes as well as future plans and goals. Together we shape the vision for React Native to make it the best way to build applications.

The list of partners can expand and contract over time. At the time of writing the current list of partners is, in alphabetic order: Callstack, Expo, Facebook, Infinite Red, Microsoft, and Software Mansion. Among these partners are creators and stakeholders in the React Native Community organization.

## React Native Community organization: formalizing a decision process

The motivating example for the need for a more formalized decision process can be seen by looking at the ["What packages belong in react-native-community?"](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/176) issue, which has remained open for nearly a year and a half despite being a fundamental question for the organization. Part of the reason that this question remained unanswered for so long is that there wasn't any formal decision making process in place for the organization and nobody wanted or had the authority to act unilaterally, so it wasn't clear how to proceed.

The creators of the React Native Community organization decided that a practical way to make good decisions for the organization would be to have representatives from each of the React Native partner organizations vote on any proposals for significant changes. This would ensure that a diverse range of interests were considered while still limiting the number of parties involved to a small enough group to minimize overhead.

To initialize a governance model, representatives from the partners took a vote that on the first proposal: "decisions that will meaningfully change the react-native-community organization will require approval by a majority of partners". To give all partners a voice in the initial decision, we agreed that this vote to establish majority rule would need to be passed unanimously.

The vote passed 6-0, establishing a governance model where partners can make decisions on behalf of the react-native-community by majority rule.
