# Partners

Members of the organizations [listed as partners on the react-native repository](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/ECOSYSTEM.md#partners) collaborate to manage the React Native Community organization and related community tools, such as React Native Directory. Decisions that will meaningfully change the React Native Community organization require approval by a majority of partners.

The scope of responsibility and list of partners is expected to change over time, and will be documented here alongside other decisions and actions.
