# React Native: Discussions and Proposals

Do you have an idea on how to make React Native better?

Do you want to discuss an aspect of the framework?

This repository is the right place to do so!

## Introduction

This repository was born by the desire of more transparency and a dedicated communication channels among members of the community.

In order to do so, it has been decided to focus this repository to provide a safe environment to propose and generate interesting conversations related to the [main React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository.

### Discussions

React Native is still a young framework, and its rapid release cycle leaves the door open for discussing how it can evolve at every step of the way.

The issue section of this repository is open for anyone to propose a subject related to the React Native library that deserves a discussion.

### RFCs

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to be proposed and championed to then enter the project.

It is inspired by the [React RFC repo](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs), but today we don't expect for every substantial change to go through this process; however, we hope that this brings more awareness to the community.

### Core Meetings

The top contributors regularly meet to discuss ongoing problems with the goal of drafting solution proposals. The [core meetings](core-meetings/README.md) directory contains meeting notes and topics for this process.

## CoC

Similarly to the main repository, this project has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.
